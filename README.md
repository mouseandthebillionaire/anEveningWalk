# An Evening Walk
It's evening and you are out for a silent stroll. Take a breath. Don't try and rush it. The journey is the destination.  

An Evening Walk is an exploration in creating meditative spaces in video games. It borrows heavily from Mot's amazing Creating a pseudo 3D racer tutorial

# Statement
This game comes out of an interest in how games use the idea of space. Instead of running to the next fight or the next puzzle, how can we force the player to pause and reflect? To be separate from the gameplay? To sit and be still in empty space. Normally this is anethema to the designer. We try to have as few loading screens as possible that work as quickly as they can. The player is impatient. A few games break this. Red Dead Redemption 2 forces the player to traverse the wide open spaces on their way to the next mission. That was our favorite part of the game. Especially once you got he hang of the 'autopilot' you could swivel the camera, take a look at the scenery as it slowly passed by, and possible reflect. But what if there is no 'destination?' What if, as in real life, the point of taking a walk is to slow down, be in the moment, and reflect. 

The mechanics built into this game try and force this paradigm. There is no timer. There is no extraneous music or sound to stimulate. We don't let the player rapidly flick their fingers between Z and X. A space is forced. A certain slowness and rhythm is expected. And when the player succumbs to this restraint we hope that it is possible to enter a mode of reflection.

Enjoy your walk.
